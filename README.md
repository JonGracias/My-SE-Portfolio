# Portfolio Frontend (Next.js + Azure)

A production Next.js portfolio website that showcases GitHub projects using live data, deployed on Azure with CI/CD.

---

## Overview

This repository contains the frontend for my personal developer portfolio, available at:

https://gracias.cloud

The site is built with Next.js and TypeScript and dynamically displays my GitHub repositories, including metadata such as descriptions, languages, and activity. It is designed to demonstrate real-world frontend engineering, cloud deployment, and DevOps practices rather than serving as a static résumé.

- Server-rendered Next.js application
- Dynamic GitHub API integration for live repository data
- Responsive, accessible UI built with Tailwind CSS
- Type-safe codebase using TypeScript
- Environment-based configuration for local and production builds
- Automated deployment to Azure using GitHub Actions
